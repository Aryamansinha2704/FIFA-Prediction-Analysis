# Fifa-Prediction-Analysis
Creating a statistical and a machine learning model to predict the finish of the 2020/2021 English premier league soccer season
## Motivation
Soccer is a very unpredictable sport which is partly the reason it boasts the title of being the most popular sport in the world. As soccer fans ourselves, we sought out to see if we could develop a predictor for the English season for the upcoming year.
## Data Sets 
We used 2 primary data, one of the results of matches and another of player attributes and teams from the FIFA game. The matches data set is from the last 5 years and the top 5 European soccer leagues(English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga).

## Conclusions
On some runs we achieved an accuracy as high as 55.5% which might seem low but is actually higher than that on most betting websites due to the unpredictable nature of the sport. As there are 3 possible results(win, lose, draw) to every game, any accuracy above 33% is telling us something about which way the match is likely to go. Our prediction for this year's premier league suggests Liverpool will win the league again while Leeds United will be relegated in their first year back. The whole table can be viewed towards the end of the notebook. There were some limitations we couldn't account for like team trends over long periods of times, the effect of no longer having a home advantage due to the lack of fans in stadiums as a consequence of COVID-19 and injuries to key players.
